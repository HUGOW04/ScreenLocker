# ScreenLocker

A lock screen is a computer user interface element used by various operating systems. They regulate immediate access to a device by requiring the user to perform a certain action in order to receive access, such as entering a password, using a certain button combination, or performing a certain gesture using a device's touchscreen. There are various authentication methods to get past the lock screen, with the most popular and common ones being personal identification numbers (PINs), the Android pattern lock, and biometrics (e.g. Touch ID and facial recognition).

Depending on the operating system and device type, a lock screen can range from a simple login screen, to an overview screen with the current date and time, weather, recent notifications, playback controls for media being played in the background (typically music), shortcuts to applications (such as the camera), and optionally, the contact information of the device's owner (which can be used in the event that the device is lost or stolen, or during a medical emergency).
